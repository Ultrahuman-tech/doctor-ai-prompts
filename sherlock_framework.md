# SHERLOCK MD Diagnostic Framework (Reference Material)

Use this framework when you need to:
- Look up optimal/standard/elite ranges for health markers
- Identify disease triggers that require immediate attention
- Calculate confidence scores for your analysis
- Understand cross-pool patterns and correlations

This is **reference material** for detailed health analysis. The Strict Rules above take priority over guidance here.

## LEGEND (Use Throughout)

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **S/O/E** | Standard/Optimal/Elite thresholds |
| **T/B/C** | Temporal/Breadth/Consistency (confidence dimensions) |
| **[D]** | Disease trigger - diagnose immediately |
| **[HVI]** | High-Value Insight opportunity |
| **M/F** | Male/Female |
| **Dx** | Diagnosis |
| **Rx** | Treatment/Intervention |
| **Ref** | Referral needed |

---

## 1. CORE RULES

### Two Tracks
- **Track 1 (DISEASE)**: Pathological finding - Flag immediately for professional evaluation
- **Track 2 (OPTIMIZE)**: Suboptimal, not pathological - Investigate until confidence >= 7/9

### Confidence Score (Calculate for complex analyses)
```
Temporal (T):  _/3  (0=snapshot, 1=one prior, 2=trend, 3=rich history)
Breadth (B):   _/3  (0=one metric, 1=two, 2=three-four, 3=five+)
Consistency:   _/3  (0=conflict, 1=weak, 2=moderate, 3=strong)
TOTAL:         _/9
<7 = More data helpful | >= 7 = High confidence conclusion
```

## 2. DISEASE TRIGGERS [D] - Flag for Professional Evaluation

| Finding | Indication | Action |
|---------|------------|--------|
| HbA1c >= 6.5% OR Fasting Glucose >= 126 | Diabetes range | Recommend diabetes evaluation |
| HbA1c 5.7-6.4 + FG 100-125 | Prediabetes | Recommend metabolic evaluation |
| TSH > 10 | Hypothyroid range | Recommend thyroid evaluation |
| TSH < 0.1 + elevated FT4/FT3 | Hyperthyroid | Recommend urgent endo evaluation |
| eGFR < 30 | CKD Stage 4+ | Recommend nephrology referral |
| ALT/AST > 3x upper limit | Liver concern | Recommend hepatology workup |
| Hgb < 8 | Severe anemia | Recommend urgent evaluation |
| BP > 180/120 | Hypertensive urgency | Recommend immediate attention |
| K < 3.0 or > 6.0 | Critical electrolyte | Recommend urgent evaluation |
| Lp(a) > 150 nmol/L | Very high CVD risk | Recommend aggressive prevention |

**Rule**: If [D] present, flag clearly and recommend professional evaluation. Don't investigate further.

## 4. HIGH-VALUE INSIGHT PATTERNS [HVI]

### Pattern Types
| Pattern | Type | Insight Hook |
|---------|------|--------------|
| "Normal" at suboptimal end + symptoms | Hidden Connection | "Technically normal but functionally deficient" |
| Multiple markers pointing same direction | Root Cause | "4 findings trace to one cause" |
| Marker conflicts with lifestyle | Counterintuitive | "Despite doing X, body shows Y" |
| Good baseline, optimization gap | Opportunity | "Room for improvement in X" |

### Example Insights

**Metabolic:**
> "Glucose 95 'normal' + insulin 15 = pancreas working overtime = early insulin resistance"

**Thyroid:**
> "TSH 2.8 + FT4 1.1 'normal' but FT3 2.5 + RT3 22 = poor T4-to-T3 conversion"

**Cardiovascular:**
> "LDL-C 100 looks fine but ApoB 120 + Lp(a) 65 = elevated cardiovascular risk"

**Body Composition:**
> "BMI 24 'healthy' but body fat 31% + high visceral fat = metabolically at risk despite normal weight"

---

## 5. CROSS-DOMAIN PATTERNS

### Metabolic Syndrome Cluster
**Markers**: Elevated insulin + triglycerides + low HDL + elevated HbA1c + high uric acid + visceral fat
**Root cause**: Insulin resistance
**Insight**: "Not 5 separate problems - one upstream cause creating downstream effects"

### Chronic Inflammation Cluster
**Markers**: Elevated hsCRP + homocysteine + gut permeability + low omega-3 + oxidative stress
**Root cause**: Often gut barrier dysfunction + omega imbalance
**Insight**: "Inflammation is the response - look for the source"

### HPA Dysfunction Pattern
**Markers**: Flat cortisol curve + low AM cortisol + low DHEA-S + elevated reverse T3 + low HRV + poor sleep
**Root cause**: Circadian/stress dysregulation
**Insight**: "Not 'just stress' - measurable HPA dysfunction affecting multiple systems"

## 6. DATA SOURCE PRIORITY

When analyzing health data, check the most definitive sources first:

| Query Type | Primary Source | Secondary | Tertiary |
|------------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| Cardiovascular | HRV/RHR from wearable, CAC score | Advanced lipids (ApoB, Lp(a)) | Standard lipids |
| Metabolic | CGM data (if available) | Fasting insulin + HOMA-IR | HbA1c + fasting glucose |
| Sleep quality | Sleep tracker data (stages, efficiency) | HRV patterns | Self-reported |
| Recovery/Stress | HRV trends, recovery scores | Cortisol patterns | Sleep quality |
| Fitness | VO2 max, workout data | Resting HR trends | Activity levels |

---

## 7. ANALYSIS BEST PRACTICES

### Always Quantify
- "3x the risk" not "higher risk"
- "15% improvement" not "better"
- Compare to baselines when available

### Look for Patterns
- Single data points are snapshots
- Trends are more meaningful
- Cross-reference multiple data types

### Prioritize Actionability
- What can the user actually change?
- Focus on highest-impact modifications
- Consider user's context and constraints

# Common Score Interpretations

**"Why is my sleep score low despite sleeping 8 hours?"**
Total duration is only one contributor (20-70% weight). Low scores can result from:
- Poor sleep efficiency (time awake in bed)
- Elevated temperature deviation
- Insufficient deep or REM sleep
- Inconsistent sleep timing
- High restlessness (toss/turn)

**"Why is my recovery score low after a good night's sleep?"**
Recovery depends on more than sleep:
- Elevated RHR or suppressed HRV
- Temperature deviation
- Previous day's training load
- Stress patterns

**"Why does my HRV vary so much day to day?"**
HRV naturally fluctuates based on:
- Sleep quality
- Training load
- Alcohol consumption
- Stress and mental load
- Illness
- Hydration
Look at 7-day trends rather than daily values.

**"What does a high/low temperature deviation mean?"**
- High deviation: Possible illness, alcohol, late eating, hot room, or (for women) luteal phase
- Low deviation: Typically less concerning; often indicates good sleep environment

**"Why is my movement score low?"**
Common causes:
- Below step goal
- Too much inactive time
- Uneven activity distribution (all steps in one burst)
- Missed workouts

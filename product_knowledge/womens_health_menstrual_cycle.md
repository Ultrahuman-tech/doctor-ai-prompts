# Women's Health - Menstrual Cycle

**Understanding Your Cycle Phases:**

Ultrahuman tracks four main phases of the menstrual cycle, each with distinct characteristics:

**1. Menstrual Phase (Period)**
- **When**: Days 1-5 of your cycle (day 1 = first day of period)
- **What's happening**: Uterine lining sheds
- **How you might feel**: Energy may be lower, some cramping
- **Biomarker patterns**: RHR and body temperature typically drop to lowest levels

**2. Follicular Phase**
- **When**: Days 1-13 (overlaps with menstrual phase initially)
- **What's happening**: Estrogen rises, follicles develop in ovaries
- **How you might feel**: Energy typically increases, often feel strongest
- **Biomarker patterns**: HRV tends to be higher
- **Best for**: High-intensity workouts, challenging projects

**3. Ovulation Phase**
- **When**: Around day 14 (varies by individual)
- **What's happening**: Egg is released from ovary
- **How you might feel**: May notice increased energy, some feel mild discomfort
- **Biomarker patterns**: Brief temperature dip followed by sustained rise

**4. Luteal Phase**
- **When**: Days 15-28 (until next period starts)
- **What's happening**: Progesterone rises, body prepares for potential pregnancy
- **How you might feel**: Energy may fluctuate, PMS symptoms may appear in late luteal
- **Biomarker patterns**: Temperature elevated 0.3-0.5°C (0.5-0.9°F), HRV may be lower, RHR may increase 2-5 bpm
- **Best for**: Moderate activity, recovery-focused training

**Phase-Specific Biomarker Changes:**
- **HRV**: Typically higher in follicular phase, lower in luteal phase
- **RHR**: May increase 2-5 bpm in luteal phase
- **Temperature**: 0.3-0.5°C (0.5-0.9°F) higher in luteal phase (Ultrahuman adjusts baselines automatically)
- **Sleep**: May be more disrupted in late luteal phase

**Ovulation & Fertility Tracking:**
- **Fertile Window**: The days around ovulation when conception is most likely
- **Ovulation Prediction**: Based on your temperature patterns and cycle history
- **Anovulation Detection**: Cycles without a clear temperature shift may indicate no ovulation occurred

**Cycle Tracking Tips:**
- Log your period start date for accurate predictions
- Normal cycle length: 21-35 days
- Ultrahuman provides a buffer period after your predicted period end before marking as late
- Irregular cycles (varying significantly) may be worth discussing with a doctor

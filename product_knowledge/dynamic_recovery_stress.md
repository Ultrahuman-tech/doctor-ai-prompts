# Dynamic Recovery and Stress

**Dynamic Recovery:**
A real-time recovery metric that updates throughout the day based on activities and interventions.

- **How it works**: Starts with morning recovery score, adjusts based on:
  - Breathwork sessions: Can boost recovery up to +10 points
  - Naps: Recalculates recovery score after quality naps
  - Stress events: Detected through HRV patterns
  - Activity: Intense activity may temporarily reduce dynamic recovery

**Stress Indicators:**
- **Cortisol Rhythm**: Inferred from HRV patterns throughout the day
- **Stress Events**: Detected when HRV drops significantly outside of activity
- **Autonomic Balance**: Ratio of sympathetic (stress) to parasympathetic (rest) activity

**Recovery Boosters:**
- **Breathwork**: Guided breathing sessions (>15 mins) can improve HRV and boost recovery
- **Power Naps**: 15-30 minute naps can restore alertness and recovery
- **Meditation**: Tracked mindfulness sessions support recovery

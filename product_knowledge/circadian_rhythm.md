# Circadian Rhythm and Phase Alignment

**Understanding Your Body Clock:**

Your body has a natural 24-hour rhythm that affects when you feel alert, sleepy, and physically strong. Ultrahuman tracks this using your temperature patterns during sleep.

**Temperature Minimum ("Minima")**
- The lowest point of your body temperature during sleep
- Usually occurs a few hours before your natural wake time
- This is the anchor point for calculating your personalized circadian zones

**Your Circadian Zones:**

Based on your temperature minimum, we calculate personalized zones:

1. **Minima Zone**
   - Your body's biological "midnight"
   - Avoid bright light and vigorous activity during this time

2. **Phase Advance Zone**
   - Morning light and exercise during this window can help you wake up earlier over time
   - Great for: Morning workouts, getting sunlight
   - Being active during this window can boost your Movement score

3. **Phase Delay Zone**
   - Light and activity during this window can shift your body clock later
   - This is typically your evening time

4. **Dead Zone**
   - Light and activity have minimal impact on your circadian rhythm
   - Normal daytime activities are fine here

**Chronotype:**
Your natural sleep-wake preference:
- **Early Bird/Lark**: Naturally wake early, peak energy in morning
- **Night Owl**: Naturally stay up late, peak energy in evening
- **Intermediate**: Flexible timing, middle ground

**Calibration Status:**
- **Calibrating**: Still collecting data (need sufficient sleep records)
- **Calibrated**: Enough data for reliable zone calculations
- After travel to a new timezone, recalibration begins automatically

**Social Jetlag:**
The difference between weekday and weekend sleep midpoints:
- **Under 30 minutes**: Consistent schedule, minimal circadian disruption
- **30-60 minutes**: Mild disruption, manageable
- **Over 60 minutes**: Significant circadian stress, may affect Monday energy

Tip: Keeping weekend sleep within 1 hour of weekday patterns helps maintain circadian health.

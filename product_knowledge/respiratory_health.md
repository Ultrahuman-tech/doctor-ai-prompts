# Respiratory Health

**Snoring:**
- **Measurement**: Duration and percentage of sleep time spent snoring
- **What it indicates**: Airway obstruction, sleep position, congestion, alcohol effects
- **Impact on sleep**: Can disrupt sleep stages and affect sleep quality

**Coughing Events:**
- Tracked during sleep as indicators of respiratory health
- May correlate with illness, allergies, or environmental factors

**Sleep Apnea Indicators:**
While not a diagnostic tool, patterns may suggest sleep apnea risk:
- Frequent snoring combined with restlessness
- Heart rate variability during sleep
- Oxygen desaturation patterns (if tracked)

**Breathing Quality:**
Overall respiratory health during sleep affects recovery and sleep quality.

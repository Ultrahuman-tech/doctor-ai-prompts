# Cardiovascular Metrics

**Heart Rate Variability (HRV):**

HRV measures the tiny variations in time between each heartbeat (in milliseconds). Despite what you might expect, having more variability is actually good—it means your heart can adapt flexibly to different demands.

**Why HRV Matters:**
- Higher HRV generally indicates better cardiovascular fitness and recovery
- Lower HRV can signal stress, illness, overtraining, or incomplete recovery
- HRV is highly individual—focus on YOUR trends, not comparing to others

**How Your HRV Baseline and Zone Work:**
- **Baseline**: Calculated from a rolling average of your recent sleep HRV
- **Zone**: Your normal range, calculated from your historical data using statistical methods
- Individual baselines vary widely (20-100+ ms is normal depending on the person)

**Interpreting HRV Compared to Your Zone:**
- **Above your zone**: Excellent recovery, parasympathetic (rest) dominance
- **Within your zone**: Normal state for you
- **Below your zone**: Possible stress, incomplete recovery, or high training load

**What Affects HRV:**
- Age (naturally decreases with age)
- Fitness level (improves with consistent exercise)
- Alcohol (even 1-2 drinks can significantly lower HRV)
- Stress (both physical and mental)
- Sleep quality
- Illness (often drops 1-2 days before you feel sick)
- Hydration

**When It's Measured:**
Most accurate during sleep, particularly during deep sleep phases. This is why Ultrahuman focuses on sleep HRV rather than daytime readings.

**Resting Heart Rate (RHR):**
The heart rate when completely at rest, best measured during sleep.

- **Normal ranges**: 60-100 bpm general population; 40-60 bpm for athletes
- **Night RHR vs Day RHR**: Night RHR (during sleep) is typically lowest and most accurate
- **What elevated RHR indicates**: Illness, stress, overtraining, dehydration, poor recovery
- **What lowered RHR indicates**: Improved cardiovascular fitness (when trending down over time)

**Heart Rate Recovery (HRR):**
How quickly heart rate drops after exercise stops.

- Measured at 1 minute and 2 minutes post-exercise
- Faster recovery indicates better cardiovascular fitness
- Drop of >20 bpm in first minute is considered good

**AFib & Heart Rhythm Screening:**
Ultrahuman can detect irregular heart rhythms that may indicate atrial fibrillation. This is a screening tool, not a medical diagnosis.

# Sleep Index Overview

The **Sleep Index** (0-100) measures your overall sleep quality each night based on how long you slept, how restful it was, and how well your body recovered.

**What Your Score Means:**
- **90-100 (Excellent)**: Restorative sleep. Your body recovered well and you should feel energized.
- **75-89 (Good)**: Solid sleep with minor room for improvement. You're likely well-rested.
- **60-74 (Fair)**: Your sleep had some issues. You may feel less than fully refreshed.
- **Below 60 (Needs Improvement)**: Sleep quality was poor. Focus on improving sleep habits.

**What Goes Into Your Sleep Score:**

1. **Total Sleep Duration**: The total time spent in Light, Deep, and REM sleep combined. Getting enough hours is the foundation of a good score.

2. **Body Temperature**: Compares your sleep temperature to your personal baseline. Temperature close to normal = better score. Elevated temperature can lower your score.

3. **Sleep Timing Consistency**: Going to bed and waking at similar times helps your body clock. Consistent schedules lead to higher scores.

4. **Restfulness**: How much you moved or tossed/turned during the night. Less movement = more restful sleep = higher score.

5. **REM Sleep Quality**: REM is crucial for memory and mental recovery. Getting adequate REM sleep improves your score.

6. **Deep Sleep Quality**: Deep sleep is when your body physically repairs itself. Getting enough deep sleep is important for a good score.

7. **Heart Rate Pattern**: How quickly your heart rate drops to its lowest point during sleep, and how long it stays low (restoration time).

8. **Sleep Efficiency**: Percentage of time in bed actually spent sleeping. Higher efficiency = better score.

**Special Modes:**

- **New Parent Mode**:
  - Lower step goals to accommodate caring for a newborn
  - Workout frequency component is removed from Movement Index
  - More lenient scoring for fragmented sleep patterns
  - Recognizes that recovery looks different during this life stage

- **Shift Work Mode**:
  - Adapts to non-traditional sleep schedules
  - Adjusts timing-based scoring for overnight or rotating shifts
  - Recalibrates circadian expectations based on your actual sleep patterns

- **Ramadan Mode**:
  - Adapted for fasting schedule sleep patterns
  - Accounts for altered meal timing and sleep schedules during the holy month

- **Nap Integration**: Quality naps can boost your overall score

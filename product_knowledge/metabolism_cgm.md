# Metabolism (CGM Users)

For users with Continuous Glucose Monitor integration:

**Glucose Metrics:**
- **Average Glucose**: Target typically 70-100 mg/dL fasting, <140 mg/dL post-meal
- **Time in Range**: Percentage of day within target glucose zone
- **Glucose Variability**: Stability of glucose levels (lower is generally better)
- **Glucose Spikes**: Rapid rises after meals

**What Affects Glucose:**
- Food (especially carbohydrates)
- Exercise (generally lowers glucose)
- Stress (can raise glucose)
- Sleep quality (poor sleep affects glucose regulation)
- Meal timing

**Metabolic Flexibility:**
The body's ability to switch between fuel sources (carbs vs fat). Better metabolic flexibility = more stable energy levels.

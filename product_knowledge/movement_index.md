# Movement Index Overview

The **Movement Index** (0-100) tracks how active you've been throughout the day. It rewards consistent movement spread across the day, not just bursts of activity.

**What Your Score Means:**
- **90-100 (Highly Active)**: Excellent day! You moved consistently and hit your goals.
- **75-89 (Good)**: Meeting your movement targets. Keep it up!
- **60-74 (Moderate)**: Some activity, but room for more movement throughout the day.
- **Below 60 (Low Activity)**: Significantly below your goals. Try to move more tomorrow.

**What Goes Into Your Movement Score:**

1. **Active Hours**: How many hours had meaningful activity. Long periods of sitting without movement hurt this score.

2. **Inactive Time**: How much time you spent completely idle (excluding sleep and naps). Less idle time = higher score.

3. **Step Progress**: Your actual steps compared to your personalized goal. Reaching your goal = full points.

4. **Workout Frequency**: Rewards consistent workouts throughout the week. Regular exercise improves this component.

**Bonus Features:**
- **Morning Activity Bonus**: Being active during your optimal morning window (based on your circadian rhythm) can boost your score

**Activity Classifications:**
- **Workouts**: Higher intensity activities count as workouts
- **Active movement**: Moderate intensity activities count as active time

**Tips for a Better Score:**
- Spread your steps throughout the day instead of one long walk
- Take breaks from sitting every hour
- Aim for at least one workout every 2-3 days

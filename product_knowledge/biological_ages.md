# Biological Ages

Ultrahuman calculates biological ages that may differ from your chronological age. These reflect how your body is actually functioning compared to typical aging patterns.

**Brain Age**

Your Brain Age is calculated from sleep quality factors over recent nights. The science: During deep sleep, your brain's "glymphatic system" clears metabolic waste—this process is crucial for long-term brain health.

**What Goes Into Brain Age:**
- **Deep Sleep Quality**: Deep sleep is when brain cleaning happens—this is a key factor.
- **Sleep Duration**: Getting adequate total sleep time.
- **Sleep Efficiency**: Spending your time in bed actually sleeping.
- **HRV During Sleep**: Indicator of recovery quality.
- **Sleep Consistency**: Accumulated sleep debt and temperature irregularities can negatively impact your brain age score.

**Interpreting Your Brain Age:**
- Brain Age lower than your actual age = your sleep supports good brain health
- Brain Age higher than your actual age = focus on improving deep sleep and sleep quality
- The Brain Aging Index (0-100) converts this to an easy-to-read score

**Cardio Age**

Based on cardiovascular fitness indicators:
- Resting heart rate trends (lower is generally better)
- Heart rate recovery after exercise
- HRV patterns
- VO2 max estimates

**Interpreting Your Cardio Age:**
- Lower than your actual age = strong cardiovascular fitness
- Higher than your actual age = opportunity to improve through aerobic exercise

**Pulse Age**

Based on heart rhythm and pulse characteristics:
- Pulse wave patterns
- Heart rate variability trends
- Recovery patterns after exertion

**Improving Your Biological Ages:**
- **For Brain Age**: Prioritize deep sleep (avoid alcohol, keep room cool, consistent schedule)
- **For Cardio Age**: Regular cardiovascular exercise, especially Zone 2 training
- **For All Ages**: Stress management, quality sleep, healthy nutrition, avoiding excess alcohol

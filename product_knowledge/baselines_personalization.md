# Baselines and Personalization

**How Baselines Work:**
Ultrahuman establishes personal baselines over 7-14 days of data collection. Your metrics are compared to YOUR normal, not population averages.

**Types of Baselines:**
- **HRV Baseline**: Your typical HRV range during sleep
- **RHR Baseline**: Your normal resting heart rate
- **Temperature Baseline**: Your average sleep temperature
- **Sleep Stage Baselines**: Your typical sleep architecture
- **Activity Baselines**: Your normal movement patterns

**Why Personalization Matters:**
- An HRV of 40ms might be low for one person but high for another
- A RHR of 55 bpm is athletic for some, elevated for others
- Your personal trends matter more than absolute numbers

**Baseline Adjustments:**
- Baselines adapt slowly over time as fitness changes
- Phase-specific baselines account for menstrual cycle
- **New Parent Mode**: Reduces step goals, removes workout frequency scoring, and adjusts for fragmented sleep
- **Shift Work Mode**: Adapts timing-based metrics for non-traditional schedules
- **Ramadan Mode**: Accounts for fasting schedule and altered sleep patterns

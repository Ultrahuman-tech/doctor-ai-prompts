# Body Temperature

**How Temperature is Measured:**
Ultrahuman measures skin temperature at the wrist during sleep, tracking deviations from your personal baseline.

**Temperature Deviation:**
- **Normal variation**: ±0.3°C (±0.5°F) from baseline is typical
- **Elevated temperature** (>0.5°C / >0.9°F above baseline): May indicate:
  - Illness or immune response
  - Alcohol consumption
  - Late eating
  - Environmental factors (hot room)
- **Lower temperature**: Usually less concerning, may indicate deeper sleep

**Phase-Specific Baselines (Women):**
- Temperature varies across menstrual cycle phases
- Luteal phase (post-ovulation): 0.3-0.5°C (0.5-0.9°F) higher than follicular phase
- Ultrahuman adjusts baselines per cycle phase for accurate comparisons

**Illness Detection:**
Sustained elevated temperature (>0.5°C / >0.9°F above baseline for multiple nights) combined with elevated RHR can indicate illness onset, sometimes before symptoms appear.

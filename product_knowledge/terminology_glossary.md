# Terminology Glossary

- **Active Hours**: Hours with 250+ steps or detected activity
- **AFib (Atrial Fibrillation)**: Irregular heart rhythm condition
- **Autonomic Nervous System**: Controls involuntary functions; sympathetic (stress) vs parasympathetic (rest)
- **Baseline**: Your personal average for comparison
- **Body Index**: Same as Recovery Index
- **Chronotype**: Natural sleep-wake timing preference
- **Circadian Rhythm**: 24-hour internal body clock

- **Dynamic Recovery**: Real-time recovery score that updates throughout the day
- **HRR (Heart Rate Recovery)**: How quickly HR drops after exercise
- **HRV (Heart Rate Variability)**: Variation between heartbeats; higher generally indicates better recovery
- **Light Sleep (N1/N2)**: Lighter sleep stages for transitioning
- **MET (Metabolic Equivalent)**: Intensity measurement unit
- **Nocturnal Score**: Overnight sleep quality rating
- **Phase Alignment**: How well sleep timing matches circadian preference
- **REM (Rapid Eye Movement)**: Sleep stage for memory and dreams
- **RHR (Resting Heart Rate)**: Heart rate at complete rest
- **Sleep Debt**: Accumulated sleep deficit
- **Sleep Efficiency**: Actual sleep / time in bed ratio
- **Sleep Inertia**: Post-wake grogginess duration
- **Social Jetlag**: Weekday vs weekend sleep timing difference
- **WASO (Wake After Sleep Onset)**: Time awake during the night

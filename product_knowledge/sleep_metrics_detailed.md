# Sleep Metrics Detailed

**Sleep Stages:**
- **Deep Sleep (N3/Slow-Wave Sleep)**: Most restorative stage. Body repairs tissues, strengthens immune system, releases growth hormone. Typically 15-25% of total sleep. Optimal: 70-120 minutes per night.
- **REM Sleep**: Brain consolidates memories, processes emotions. Vivid dreaming occurs. Typically 20-25% of total sleep. Optimal: 90-120 minutes per night.
- **Light Sleep (N1/N2)**: Transition stages. N1 is lightest, N2 involves sleep spindles for memory. Typically 50-60% of total sleep.
- **Sleep Cycles**: Complete cycle (Light -> Deep -> REM) takes ~90 minutes. 4-6 complete cycles per night is optimal.

**Sleep Quality Metrics:**
- **Sleep Efficiency**: (Time actually sleeping / Time in bed) × 100. Above 85% is good, above 90% is excellent.
- **Sleep Debt**: Cumulative deficit when actual sleep falls short of target (typically 7-9 hours). The body tracks this over ~14 days.
- **WASO (Wake After Sleep Onset)**: Total time awake during the night after initially falling asleep. Lower is better (<20-30 mins is normal).
- **Sleep Inertia**: Duration of grogginess upon waking. Shorter duration indicates better sleep quality.
- **Toss & Turn Count**: Motion events during sleep indicating restlessness. Lower count = more restful sleep.
- **Nocturnal Score**: Overnight quality rating based on multiple factors.

**Sleep Timing:**
- **Sleep Consistency**: How regular your bedtime and wake time are day-to-day. Consistent schedules support circadian rhythm.
- **Chronotype**: Your natural preference for early (early bird/lark) vs late (night owl) sleep timing.
- **Social Jetlag**: Difference between weekday and weekend sleep midpoints. >1 hour indicates circadian disruption.

# Recovery Index (Body Index) Overview

The **Recovery Index** (also called Body Index) (0-100) measures how well your body has recovered and whether you're ready for physical activity. It can update throughout the day based on what you do.

**What Your Score Means:**
- **90-100 (Fully Recovered)**: Great day for challenging workouts or high-intensity activity.
- **75-89 (Well Recovered)**: Good for moderate to intense activity. Most normal activities are fine.
- **60-74 (Partially Recovered)**: Consider lighter activity. Your body is still recovering.
- **Below 60 (Under-Recovered)**: Prioritize rest today. Avoid intense exercise.

**What Affects Your Recovery Score:**

1. **Sleep Quality**: Your sleep score is the foundation of recovery. Poor sleep significantly impacts recovery potential.

2. **Body Temperature**: Temperature deviation from your baseline indicates how your body is doing. Higher deviation (warmer than usual) often means your immune system is active or you're stressed.

3. **Resting Heart Rate**: We look at:
   - Your actual night heart rate value
   - How it compares to your personal baseline
   - How it changed from the previous night
   Higher than normal RHR often indicates incomplete recovery, illness, or stress.

4. **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**: Higher HRV generally means better recovery. We compare your HRV to your personal zone and consider whether it's trending up or down.

5. **Previous Day Activity**: High activity yesterday may temporarily lower today's recovery.

**How Recovery Can Change During the Day:**
- **Breathwork Sessions**: Guided breathing sessions can boost your recovery score
- **Stress Events**: Detected stress (via HRV patterns) can lower your score
- **Naps**: Quality naps trigger a recalculation of your recovery score
- **Cortisol Rhythm**: Your natural stress hormone patterns can influence your score

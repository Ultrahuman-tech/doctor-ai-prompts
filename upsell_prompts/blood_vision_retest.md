Show this CTA ONLY if the response explicitly states that a blood marker
(like Vitamin D, Iron, B12, Hemoglobin, TSH, Glucose, etc.) is LOW, OUT OF RANGE,
BELOW OPTIMAL, or NEEDS ATTENTION.

Do NOT show if:
- The response merely suggests checking levels ("you might want to check...")
- The response provides general health info about markers
- The response discusses markers without stating they are problematic

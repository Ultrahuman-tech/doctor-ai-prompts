  Select when the assistant's response discusses glucose, blood sugar, metabolic health, or food's impact on energy AND the user does NOT already have CGM data.

  Trigger when:
  - User asks about glucose spikes, blood sugar, or metabolic health
  - User asks about post-meal fatigue or energy crashes after eating
  - User wants to understand how specific foods affect their body
  - User discusses diabetes prevention, insulin resistance, or prediabetes
  - User asks about weight management related to metabolism
  - Assistant recommends tracking glucose response

  Do NOT trigger when:
  - Assistant is already analyzing user's CGM/glucose data (user already has CGM)
  - Conversation is only about sleep, HRV, or recovery without glucose/metabolic context
  - User is asking about blood markers or blood tests (use blood_vision instead)
